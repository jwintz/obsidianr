# ObsidianR Reader

ObsidianR brings a focused reader mode to Obsidian for EPUB-sourced books that have been transcribed into note collections.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run apply
```

Set the `OBSIDIANR_VAULT_PATH` environment variable before running `npm run apply` to copy the compiled plugin into your vault for testing.
